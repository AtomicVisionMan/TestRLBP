## TestRLBP

### Introduction
I was given an assignment as part of a interview process, to 
> implement a simple version of a Robust Local Binary Pattern. 
> as described in http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/2013/Papers/paper0122/paper0122.pdf

The programme has the following constraints:
>- It will be a C or C++ program that will implement an RLBP of 8,1 architecture as described on the above paper.

>- It will be a command-line program that takes 2 arguments. The first argument will be anexisting source image and the second argument will be the output file location that will store the histogram of the generated RLBP.

The other major requirements have been:
>- Save the progress in a git repository - coundn't agree more! and what's better than github?!
>- Use GNU Make tools or CMake - I've abandoned Make files (sort of) for a long while. since the machines I use include . Have to be CMake.



### Day 1
I've got the assignment rather late due to some agency issues. Have to manage it over weekend somehow steal some time here and there.

The tasks for first day then:
1) Register a new test account on github and create test project for RLBP - done!
2) Create a shell application locally to load and save images - done!
3) Commit to github repo - done!
4) Compile OpenCV 3 on MBP (OSX 10.9.5, Xcode 6.1) - to do...

NOTE: it's
